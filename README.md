# NoteWorthy

NoteWorthy is a lightweight, offline-friendly note-taking app designed specifically for students, especially those working with math and computer science. The goal is to create a simple, distraction-free tool that supports Markdown and LaTeX, handles code beautifully, and doesnâ€™t rely on cloud services, subscription models, or bloated interfaces.
